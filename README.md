Target audience

* The target audience for this portfolio website is potential employers or businesses that would be looking to hire a web developer on contract.

Tech stack

* The tech stack used is HTML, CSS with some JavaScript to enable the nav icon responsiveness. The deployment platform is GitHub.

DESIGN DOCUMENTATION



Design Process

* After looking at some other web developer portfolio sites for inspiration, I created a moodboard on pinterest with my initial ideas. Initially I considered using a palette consisting of shades of green, white, purple and black.

* After some initial work on my site, I decided that a palette focused on the green, white and black shades would be cleaner and more professional-looking. I used the following palette generated on paletton.com as my basis.

Wireframes

* I created the following wireframes using balsamiq for my website, showing mobile and desktop layouts.
* During the process of creating the website, I made quite a few changes to better suit the content of the page.

Usability considerations

* Navigation menu changes from "burger" icon in small screen to a full navigation header in tablet- and desktop-sized layouts. Navigation menu is "sticky" to the top of the screen for ease of use. 

* Alternating colour background are used between sections to improve readability and to visually separate sections. 

* "alt" tags are included on images for accessibility.

  

DETAILS OF PLANNING PROCESS



Project Plan & Timeline

* Initially planned to have coding completed in three days to enable plenty of time for testing, documentation and adding extra features. 
* I updated this project's Trello board throughout the process to account for additional issues that arose.

SHORT ANSWER Q&A

1. *Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today:*

In 1980, Tim Berners-Lee at CERN wrote ENQUIRE which was a hypertext program that allowed scientists to keep track of information using hypertext – this was the predecessor to the World Wide Web. During the 1980s, TCP/IP became increasingly more widely adopted to interconnect network devices on the internet. Addresses on the internet were made more human-friendly when the domain name system was created in 1984 along with the first Domain Name Servers (DNS).

 

In 1990, the code for the World Wide Web was written by Berners-Lee, along with the standards for HTML, HTTP, and URLs. The first commercial ISP also emerged in 1990. SSL encryption was developed by Netscape in 1995, making it safer to conduct financial transactions online and the web became increasingly commercialised from this point on. 

 In 2007 the first iPhone launched, causing ever-increasing interest in mobile web applications and design to current times.



2. *Define and describe the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers:*

Every website lives on a web server. This web server has an IP address. which is a series of numbers like 192.168.0.1. Domain names are easily-remembered versions of those numbers such as google.com. 

Domain Name System (DNS) servers are a collection of computers on the Internet that keep a record of the domain names and IP addresses of all of the other computers on the internet. Numbers get into the DNS phonebook when a domain name is registered. When a person wants to visit a particular website, their computer will ask a DNS server for that website’s IP address. Once it gets the IP address, it communicates directly to the computer at that IP address to ask for a web page.

Web browsers are software applications that allow users to browse the web. They take code and represent it in human-readable format.



3. *Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today:*

One aspect of the development of internet technologies is the development of mobile internet technology. The internet was traditionally accessed through fixed-line services on laptops and desktop computers. However, it is now much easier to access the web on portable and wireless devices. 

Mobile internet use exceeded desktop use in the United States in 2014. Explosive growth for mobile internet traffic is being continually driven by faster speeds, smaller, feature-filled devices and an ever-growing number of applications. 

 

People’s interactions with each other have been profoundly influenced by mobile social media apps which allow people to converse with others from all over the world much more quickly and easily than at any time in history. Further, many employers are now using mobile apps for various work-related reasons, with apps centered around productivity, operations, management and some even using mobile apps to track employee health.
